* 0.3 (Unreleased)

- Handle recipe names starting with /@/

- Add *justl-go-to-recipe* function which will take you to the
  justfile where the recipe under the cursor is present. It's default
  key binding is *RET*

- Change behaviour of executing recipes. It now reads the recipe to
  see if it has any input parameters and asks the value explicitly
  along with some smart behavior for default values. Eg:

#+begin_example just
push2 version1 version2:
    echo {{version1}} {{version2}}
#+end_example

It will ask the values for both version1 and version2 explicitly in
the above case.

- Implement *justl--exec-recipe-with-args* to provide explicit
  arguments to it. It's shortcut in *justl* buffer is *w*.

* 0.2

- Address various comments from the melpa maintainers.
- Use sharp quotes *#'* to provide hints to the byte compiler which
  will warn if the function is undefined.

* 0.1

- Initial version released
