* Introduction

justl.el mode is a major mode for driving [[https://github.com/casey/just][justfiles]]. As compared to
the [[https://melpa.org/#/just-mode][just-mode]], this mode is built for listing and executing the
recipes in the justfile via the [[https://github.com/magit/transient][transient]] keymaps.

* Installation

Right now it's not available through melpa, although you can use it
via [[https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa][quelpa]]:

#+begin_example elisp
(use-package justl
  :quelpa (justl :fetcher github
                 :repo "psibi/justl.el")

  :custom
  (justl-executable "/home/sibi/bin/just")
  (justl-recipe-width 25))
#+end_example

* Usage

To list all the recipes present in your justfile, call

#+begin_example elisp
M-x justl
#+end_example

You don't have to call it from the actual justfile. Calling it from
the directory where the justfile is present should be enough.

Alternatively if you want to just execute a recipe quickly, call

#+begin_example elisp
M-x justl-execute-recipe-in-dir
#+end_example

* Shortcuts

On the just screen, place your cursor on a recipe:

#+begin_example
h => help popup
? => help popup
g => refresh
e => execute recipe
#+end_example

* Customize

- By default, justl searches the executable named *just*, you can
  change the /justl-executable/ variable to set any explicit path.
- You can also control the width of the RECIPE column in the justl
  buffer via /justl-recipe width/. By default it has a value of 20.

* Future

- Implement justfile variables related features.

* Releases

See the [[file:Changelog.org][Changelog.org]] for the list of changes.
